# Brainfuck
A simple brainfuck interpreter in Flat Assembler for x86-64 Windows (though I bet you don't even need 64 bits to run this thing, I only use 32-bits regs and stuff). Written in a few hours, it has no respect for code quality whatsoever, but meh, it works.  
**None of the examples are mine**. They're **all** stolen from either [this website](https://brainfuck.org/) or [this repo](https://github.com/sunjay/brainfuck/tree/master/examples). I couldn't write a single line of brainfuck even if my life was at stake.  
Have fun I guess. This project is litterally 4 to 5 hours of my lifetime wasted, but it was kinda funny to do.
